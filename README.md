# Unmaintained

This project is currently unmaintained. While it hasn't received updates for over 7 months, it remains fully functional. However, Nexirift is moving towards a unified authentication server using different technologies, eliminating our need for OpenID authentication. If you're interested in maintaining or contributing to this project, we welcome your involvement - please contact us at [maintain@nexirift.com](mailto:maintain@nexirift.com).

# plugin-oidc

A basic [GraphQL Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga) plugin that
adds functionality to authorize users using an OpenID Connect compatible
service.

## How does it work?

This plugin checks an access token from the `Authentication` header with an
OpenID Connect compatible server to verify if it's valid using the `introspect`
endpoint. Additionally, it passes back the response info, which includes
information like the `preferred_username`, `scope`, `email`, etc. The provided
information can then be used in the GraphQL Yoga server to identify users, such
as storing them in a database based on ID.

## Example

Please see [here](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-oidc-example) for an
example of how to use the project.
